  <li>Choose a book to fold. Make sure the book has a sturdy spine and preferably is hardcover. Also depending on how much smooth you want your lines and how much detail you want to include, choose a book with an appropriate number of pages. Small books (300-400 pages) work well for basic outlines but larger books (600-800 pages) allow more detail to be included but also take a lot longer.</li>

  <li>Choose an image you want folded. Try to find one which is a silhouette as you won't be able to express a lot of textures or fine detail in the folding. Also make sure that the image shape matches the book: if you choose an image with large height or width it won't fit the book well. Something like the following works nicely:</li>

  <li>Overlay your chosen image on this template and stretch the image to fit the number of pages in your book. Make sure to stetch the height as well to be around the height of the book. The final template should look similar to the one below. When you print you may need to split it across two pages.  </li>

  <li>To start folding, line up a side of your print out to a side of your book. Line up the end of your page with the first line (marked with a 1) on the template and make a mark at where the page cuts the image. Fold the page inwards at these markings. You want the fold to be as perpendicular as it can be for it to look smooth. It may also be useful to mark which line you just folded so you don't accidentally repeat the same fold.</li>

<p align="center">
<a href=""><img src="/images/book_folding/book_1.jpg" title="Example Image Link" width="600" height="400" /></a> 
</p>

<li>Continue this process until you reach the end of the book.</li>
</ol>

Tips:
- If you encounter a region that has two sections of the image that need to be folded, make a cut in between the two markings.

Examples I have folded:


<div class="image123">
    <div class="imgContainer">
        <img src="/images/book_folding/read_book.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
    </div>
    <div class="imgContainer">
        <img src="/images/book_folding/hp_book.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
    </div>
    <div class="imgContainer">
         <img src="/images/book_folding/cat_book.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
    </div>
</div>
