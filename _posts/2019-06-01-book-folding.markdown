  <li style="padding-left:1em; font-size:22px"><b>Choose a book to fold.</b> Ensure that the book has a sturdy spine and (preferably) is hardcover. Also, depending on how much smooth and how much detail you wish to include, choose a book with an appropriate number of pages: small books (300-400 pages) work well for basic outlines but larger books (600-800 pages) allow for more detail to be included but also take a lot longer.</li>

  <li style="padding-left:1em; font-size:22px"><b>Choose an image to fold.</b> Try to find a silhouette as you won't be able to express textures or fine detail in the folding. Also ensure that the image shape matches the book: if you choose an image with large height or width it won't fit the book well.</li>

  <li style="padding-left:1em; font-size:22px"><b>Print the image.</b> Overlay your chosen image onto <a href="http://www.seesawstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/book_folding_template.pdf">this</a> template and stretch the image to fit the number of pages in your book. Make sure to stetch the height as well to be just less than the height of the book. The final template should look similar to the one below. When you print you may need to split it across two pages.  </li>

</p>


  <li style="padding-left:1em; font-size:22px"><b>Start folding.</b> Line up a side of your print out to a side of your book, then line up the edge of your book page with the first line (marked with a 1) on the template and make a mark at where the page cuts the image. Fold the page inwards at these markings. You want the fold to be as perpendicular as it can be for a clean, smooth appearance. It may also be useful to mark which line you just folded to avoid repeating the same fold.</li>

</p>

<li style="padding-left:1em; font-size:22px"><b>Continue</b> this process until you reach the end of the book.</li>
</ol>

Notes:
<ul>
 <li style="padding-left:1em; font-size:22px">If you encounter a region that has two sections of the image that need to be folded, make a cut in between the two markings. There is an alternate method where you can alternate which section to fold, however I have found that you lose more detail and eat through pages faster.</li>
