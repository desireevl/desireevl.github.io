Hi I'm Desiree, welcome to my blog. 

Currently, I am working as a data scientist as I complete my undergrad degree in physics. I enjoy learning about quantum computing, spending time with my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/mr.miso.oz/) and figure skating.

Feel free to contact me at [desireevogtlee at gmail].
